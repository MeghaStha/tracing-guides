<h2 class="section-heading">Pokhara, Nepal</h2>

 <p>Pokhara is located near the base of the Himalayas, where the residents are subject to earthquakes and flooding events from the Seti Gandaki River. Help us to map critical infrastructure in Pokhara. Using current high-resolution imagery, we will digitize roads, buildings and open areas within the city. OpenStreetMap will be used as the platform to digitize and store data for usage by first responders, planners and geospatial enthusiasts.</p>
