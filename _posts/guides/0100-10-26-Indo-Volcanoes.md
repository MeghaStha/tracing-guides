<h1 class="section-heading">Indonesian Volcanoes</h1>

<p>Many active volcanoes lack open data about the infrastructure surrounding them, making it difficult to determine risk posed by volcanic hazards. This problem is especially evident in Indonesia. As a nation made up of thousands of volcanic islands, most of the cities are located within close proximity to active volcanoes. Since 1980, approximately 300,000 Indonesians have been affected at a cost of $160 million USD. Despite number of affected Indonesians, very little effort has been made to map the surrounding communities.</p>

<p>Despite the risks associated with volcanic events, many people live near active volcanoes. Itâ€™s somewhat unavoidable when a country is made up of many volcanic islands. The location of major cities in Indonesia presents a problem for disaster management agencies who struggle to mitigate the risks volcanoes pose to local populations. In order to plan for the eventuality of a volcanic event some basic information is essential.</p>
