<h1 class="section-heading">Objective</h1>

The OpenStreetMap community has successfully mapped IDP sites around Kathmandu quickly after the Earthquake hit. It is important to now update the sites and record changes that have occurred.

<p>
<p>

This is an advanced project. Two different imagery sources must be used in order to evaluate changes. Using <a href="https://josm.openstreetmap.de/">JOSM editor</a> is highly recommended to be able to quickly switch between layers and more easily input the advanced tags.

<p>
<p>
Tip: You can easily show or hide imagery layers in JOSM by pressing alt+NUMBER, where NUMBER is the number of the layer, starting with 1 at the bottom of the list and counting up from there, so alt+3 will show/hide the third layer from the bottom.
