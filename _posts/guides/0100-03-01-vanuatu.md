<h2 class="section-heading">Vanuatu, March 2015 Cyclones</h2>

<p>Following the landing of this cyclone, as severe as the Haiyan typhoon, many deaths are reported, and communications are cut. The various international organizations are planning the response. The extent of the zone to cover from the north to the south is 650 km long. The post-assessment evaluation will be difficult and the pre-disaster informations very usefull for the response.

In this context, the basemap will be useful for a rapid response.</p>
