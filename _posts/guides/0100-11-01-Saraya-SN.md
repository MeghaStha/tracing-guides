<h1 class="section-heading">Saraya Tracing</h1>

Malaria is endemic throughout Senegal. As part of the ProAct malaria case management system, the Peace Corps Stomp Out Malaria program in Senegal is requesting assistance building a better base map of villages in the Saraya district of southern Senegal. In collaboration with the Senegalese Ministry of Health, Peace Corps and Senegalese public health professionals will conduct a study to determine the importance of geographic proximity in malaria transmission. In other words, the team seeks to determine whether all members of a household should be preemptively treated for malaria if one member tests positive. The purpose of these tasks is to trace missing buildings and roads.
