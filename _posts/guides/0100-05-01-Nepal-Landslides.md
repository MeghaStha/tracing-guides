<h1 class="section-heading">Objective</h1>

The goal is to map earthquake induced landslides and roads blocked by debris or visibly damaged. Please compare with any previous background imagery available to make sure the landslide occurred recently and possibly induced by the 2015 earthquake.

<p>
<p>

This is an advanced project. Two different imagery sources must be used in order to evaluate changes. Using <a href="https://josm.openstreetmap.de/">JOSM editor</a> is highly recommended to be able to quickly switch between layers and more easily input the advanced tags.

<p>
<p>
Tip: You can easily show or hide imagery layers in JOSM by pressing alt+NUMBER, where NUMBER is the number of the layer, starting with 1 at the bottom of the list and counting up from there, so alt+3 will show/hide the third layer from the bottom.
