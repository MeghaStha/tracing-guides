Rivers get traced two ways: first as ways (that's OSM-talk for "lines"), then as areas. First, click "Line" (Shortcut: 2) and trace the middle of the waterway. The direction you trace in represents the direction of flow. If you aren't sure about which way the water flows, it's safe to assume south (towards the ocean). If it's wrong, someone will correct this later. Once you're finished, tag the river as "Water", then as "River". Next, trace the area of the waterway (Shortcut: 3). When you're finished, tag it as "Water" and then manually enter "Water: River".
