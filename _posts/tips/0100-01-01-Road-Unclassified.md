#### Road = Unclassified:

An unclassified road is the lowest classification for a roads in Bangladesh as defined by the Roads and Highways Department of the Ministry of Communications (RHD). For a breakdown of the proposed road conventions in Bangladesh please reference the <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_Bangladesh" target="_blank">Bangladesh OSM wiki</a>.

Unclassified roads have a loose packed surface or can be paved with bricks.  They are very narrow and could support a small motorized vehicle.  These roads are hard to see due to tree canopy, and are located off of Zilla (secondary) roads.
