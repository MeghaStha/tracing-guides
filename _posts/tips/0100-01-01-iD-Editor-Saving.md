When tracing features, please remember to save early and often. Accumulating too many unsaved features may cause an error, losing all of your work. This is especially true for larger featuers that overlap squares such as waterways or roads. These features are continuous and appear in multiple cells across the project area which can cause errors when edited by multiple users. 

When saving, please do not alter the predefined changeset comments.
