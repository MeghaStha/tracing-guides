Have an initial quick scan around to see if you will be continuing or will be invalidating the square. If it is obvious that major improvements need to be made, click on the 'invalidate' button on the tasking manager & add a comment explaining what needs to be done. The most frequent problem is a simple one that anyone can make, and the square has somehow been marked as complete, when it is obvious that the whole or majority of the square is still to be mapped â€“ this type of error does not really need a message to the mapper, and may even be a software glitch (That's what we all claim). Do not invalidate a square for something that is not a requirement of the task.
