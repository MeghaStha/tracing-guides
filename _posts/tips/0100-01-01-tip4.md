## Points of interest

"Point of interest" is a general term for a real world point-like feature noteworthy enough to include it on a map. Some examples are restaurants, caf√©s, shops, banks, churches, public toilets and water fountains. There's not a single point of interest tag key in OpenStreetMap but a variety that can be used for mapping a point of interest: `amenity=`, `shop=`, `tourism=` are some examples.
