"homestead water bodies" are manmade water catchments near buildings or homes. Water colour will vary greatly depending on the purpose of the catchment. The procedure for tracing a homestead water body is the same for tracing a pond. Select "Area" (Shortcut: 3) and trace the water body. When you're finished, tag it as "Water", and then as "Pond".
