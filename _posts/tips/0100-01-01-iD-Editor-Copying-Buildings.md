There may be residential or commercial areas where buildings next to each other are identical (usually by design). To save time, you may want to copy and paste the buildings. To do this, simply trace and tag the first building. Once you have the first building set, press CTRL-C on your keyboard. From there, simply press CTRL-V to paste the building as many times as necessary.
