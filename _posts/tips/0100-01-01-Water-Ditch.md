#### Waterway = Ditch (Khal)

A ditch is a small to medium depression built to channel water. Ditches can be used to move water for irrigation, drain water from low lying areas, and are often found along the roadside to prevent flooding and help keep roads open during the wet season.  Ditches usually flow to or from a larger body of water, such as a river or large pond.

Here is an example of a ditch.  This ditch is used to drain water from adjacent fields so they can be used for agriculture purposes.  Notice the small bridge and large truck on the Zilla road in the photo.
