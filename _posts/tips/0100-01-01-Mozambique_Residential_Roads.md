The majority of unmapped roads you see in the imagery should be classified as "residential". As the name implies, these roads connect houses and run through neighborhoods. These roads are hard packed dirt, can be easily seen but won't look particularly wide - most of them are only about one lane wide. When in doubt, classify a road as residential.
