  <li><b><i>Highway tags are correct?</i></b> Some mappers tag every highway as a track because they are not paved, but this is not a meaningful criteria in some developing countries considering the amount of unpaved roads. Check the wiki definitions, perhaps the <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Highway_Tag_Africa">Highway_Tag_Africa</a> is relevant & you should research there before going any further.
Road geometry.</li> 
  <li><b><i>Road Geometry</i></b> Some mappers do not put enough details and others too much (eg a node every 10 or 20 m even if the road is straight). Delete extra nodes if they actually make a straight road weave.</li>
