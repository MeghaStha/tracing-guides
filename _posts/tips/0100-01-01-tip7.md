### Building as point of interest

Sometimes the building itself is considered the point of interest. Think for instance of a MacDonalds restaurant in an urban multi-use building versus a MacDonalds drive through in a suburban strip mall. Or - often easy to spot from satellite imagery - think of a place of worship like a church. In such cases the building itself should be tagged as a point of interest. Here's a church that has first been mapped as a single node in a building. The example shows how all tags from the node are transferred to the building and then the node is removed.
