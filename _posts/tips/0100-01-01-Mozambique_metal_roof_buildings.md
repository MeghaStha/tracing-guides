Many buildings in Mozambique are made with mud and brick and have a metal roof.  Metal roofing material can come in various colors, shapes, and sizes.  Metal roof buildings can be identified by their square or rectangle shape, and usually have a defined pitch to displace rainwater during the wet season.
