The roads are all unpaved, but we want to distinguish between them. We will use three classifications: tertiary road, residential road, and track. 

- *Residential*. The majority of roads that you see in the imagery should be classified as "residential". These roads are easily seen but won't look particularly wide - most of them are only about one lane wide. When in doubt, classify a road as residential.
- *Tertiary*. The most obvious, widest paths that you see should be classified as "tertiary roads". These roads are easily seen in the drone imagery and will seem wide enough for two cars to pass.
- *Tracks*. The remaining paths that you see should be classified as "tracks". Tracks are trails and paths that only a 4WD vehicle, a motorbike, or a pedestrian would be able to travel. They will be faint and difficult to see, they might appear and then disappear, and they may look like footpaths between houses or within a single piece of property.

These images should give a general sense of what these features look like. Note that many of the existing roads are misclassified as tracks but should actually be residential roads - keep an eye out if you are mapping this area.
