### Highway = Trunk:

A National Highway (Trunk) is the highest Road classification in the transportation network as defined by Roads and Highways Department of the Ministry of Communications (RHD).  For a breakdown of the proposed road conventions in Bangladesh please reference the  <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_Bangladesh" target="_blank">Bangladesh OSM wiki</a>.

National Highways are paved, have road surface markings, and have multiple lanes.
