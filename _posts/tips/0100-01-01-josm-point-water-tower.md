You can draw a point feature in JOSM by just selecting the Draw Nodes tool and double-clicking. You can then add the necessary tags, the correct tag for a water tower is man_made=water_tower

Note that some features such as water towers, pools, and basketball courts can be drawn with either a polygon or a point.
