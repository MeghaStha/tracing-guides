When we trace a building, we are trying to trace its footprint. But when mapping tall buildings, the angle of the imagery often makes it difficult to see where the building meets the ground. Instead, you may find it easier to trace the outline of the roof and then move that into the correct place. You can do this by clicking "Area" (Shortcut:3) and tracing the roof outline. When you've completed the shape, hover over the outline and select "Move" (Shortcut: m), then drag it to the correct place. You may also wish to square the corners of the building (Shortcut: s)
