Impromptu IDP settlements in urban areas are located in non build-up portions of a city.  They can usually be identified by bright orange or blue tents arranged in a non linear fashion within open areas.  Open areas usually consist of parks, school yards, athletic fields, or other small open areas in a city.  

An Area IDP settlement will usually have 5 or more tents.  Please trace the extent of the entire open area, this will allow for calculations of IDP space and can assist with the overall response.
