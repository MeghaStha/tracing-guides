No matter whether it's an overland road, a city street, a foot path or a cycleway, you'll find it tagged with the `highway` key. Here are some examples of common tags:

- `highway=residential` - a residential road in a city
- `highway=motorway` - a fast restricted access road
- `highway=footway` - a foot path
- `highway=cycleway` - a cycleway

Roads often come with secondary tags, further specifying type or attribute of a road:

- `oneway=yes` says a road is a one way
- `lanes=2` says how many lanes a road has
- `name=Broadway` designates a street name
- `access=private|permissive` describes the level of access on a road
- `service=parking_aisle|driveway` further specifies the type of `highway=service`
