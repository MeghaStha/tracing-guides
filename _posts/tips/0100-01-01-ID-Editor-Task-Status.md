When finished with a square, please mark progress accordingly. If you have mapped all features in your square, mark the task as "Mark task as done". If there are still features to map, please "Unlock" the task with a short explanation of what you contributed and features are missing. If the imagery in your task is unusable, please mark the task as done, but add a comment explaining the issue - "Cloudy Imagery," "Imagery does not cover the whole task," etc.
